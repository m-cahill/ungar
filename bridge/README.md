# UNGAR Bridge Package

This is the bridge/adapter layer for UNGAR. It provides integrations with external frameworks (e.g., RediAI, Gym) without coupling the core `ungar` library to them.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ungar-bridge
```

(Note: This requires `ungar` core to be installed).

## Usage

See `docs/bridge.md` in the main repository for details on adapters.
