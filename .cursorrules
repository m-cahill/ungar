# IMPORTANT:

# Always read ungar.md before writing any code.

# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update ungar.md.

# Document the entire database schema in ungar.md.

# For new migrations, make sure to add them to the same file.


# Ensure that any proposed changes help maintain or improve the modularity of the code. The code should remain well-organized into focused, manageable modules.

# Every suggestion should reinforce the practice of thorough commenting and clear documentation. It is essential that future developers can easily understand and maintain the code.

# All modules and functions should include verbose commenting.

# Ensure that the modules and necessary files are not needlessly spread out in different directories. The main code and files should be in a portable, well-structured directory making it easier to copy and access those files without ancillary files getting in the way.
