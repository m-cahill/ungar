No questions. The plan is clear and builds directly on the M00/M01 foundation.
I have analyzed the codebase and confirmed:
- `src/ungar/tensor.py` provides the necessary `CardTensor` and partition validation.
- The project structure is flat, so adding `src/ungar/game.py` and a `src/ungar/games/` package is straightforward.
- Existing tests provide a good pattern for new tests.

Ready to proceed with M02-A through M02-D.
